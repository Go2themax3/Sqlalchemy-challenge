# Sqlalchemy-challenge
Overview
This repository contains a climate analysis and exploration of Hawaii based on data stored in an SQLite database. The analysis uses Python, SQLAlchemy, ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Additionally, a Flask app provides an API for the data, enabling users to retrieve temperature and precipitation data for Honolulu, Hawaii.
